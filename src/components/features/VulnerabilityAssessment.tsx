          Night's Watch Crow's Vulnerability Assessment, a Roadmap 2026 feature, provides automated security posture evaluation for devices that lack host-based security controls or are not enrolled in CLS's BoM inventory management program. This supplementary security feature:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-cyan-200/80 pl-8 my-4">
            <li>Performs non-intrusive vulnerability scanning of network-accessible services</li>
            <li>Identifies outdated software versions and potentially vulnerable configurations</li>
            <li>Maps discovered services against known vulnerability databases</li>
            <li>Supports customizable scan policies and frequencies</li>
            <li>Enables targeted assessment of specific network segments or devices</li>
            <li>Provides vulnerability severity scoring and prioritization</li>
            <li>Integrates with network asset discovery for comprehensive coverage</li>
            <li>Complements existing BoM-based firmware vulnerability tracking</li>
            <li>Offers scheduling controls to minimize operational impact</li>
            <li>Supports scan blackout windows for sensitive operational periods</li>
          </ul>
          This capability bridges security visibility gaps for devices that cannot participate in standard host-based security controls or BoM tracking, providing stakeholders with critical vulnerability insights for their complete device inventory. The assessment framework is designed to maintain operational stability while delivering necessary security insights for unmanaged or legacy devices.
